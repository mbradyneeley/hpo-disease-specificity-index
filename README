I used the file buildHPO_tree_query.py to build the tree of nodes from hp.obo
- Then I used that framework and modified it in the *cohort_analyzer_modified.py extension
	This extension calculates the disease specificity score based on a number of factors surrounded node level based on this paper https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8398478/
- The visualize_Disease_specificity_index.ipynb visualizes the dsi's across each dataset, BG, UDN, DDD and splits the data
  median.
